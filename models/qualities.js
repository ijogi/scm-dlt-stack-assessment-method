      Transaction speed is determined by the consensus algorithm of a DLT network. 
      Consensus is the process by which nodes agree on state updates and is dependent 
      on the network structure and permission model. 
      Notable examples are Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), 
      Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).`,
