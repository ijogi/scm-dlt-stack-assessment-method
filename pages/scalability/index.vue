      Scalability refers to a DLT plaforms ability to support a high number of transactions per second (TPS),
      and is largely determined by the structure of a DLT network and the consensus mechanism used by the protocol. 
      Scalability is also tied to the level of decentralization, a relationship that is often 
      referred to as the Scalability Trilemma, according to which 
      increasing scalability of a DLT network tends to lower decentralisation and 
      network security. Scalability can also be increased with the inclusion of various technologies.
