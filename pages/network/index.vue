      DLT networks are composed of peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes running specialised software that allows to store and replicate the state of a distributed ledger. 
      Public networks allow anyone to view and instantiate transactions as well as host nodes that form the network. Public networks achieve network security and resilience through decentralisation since compromising large networks can become infeasible due to the resources it would take to do so. 
      Private networks restrict access to a network and are governed by a consortium of stakeholders or a single organisation. Private networks are more centralised, but can achieve higher transaction throughputs.

          Control over governance fits use cases where stakeholders are determined based on the purpose of the network.

          Public blockchain networks are openly accessible, meaning that every transaction is visible to anyone on the network. 
          This makes verifying data easy while providing confidentiality requires additional technologies that are not typically part of the core platform. 
          Public networks are also governed by open communities that collectively decide whatâ€™s best for a network. 
          This can protect against concentration of influence while also making the underlying network susceptible 
          to changes that may affect the operations of a SCM Dapp.
