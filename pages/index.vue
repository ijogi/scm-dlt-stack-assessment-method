          A decentralised application (DApp) is a distributed computer system that is able 
          to execute its functions independent of a centralised control system. 
          DApps make use of distributed ledgers, decentralized computing and cryptography to 
          create applications that can perform functions that would require the use of trusted 
          intermediaries in traditional centralised systems. Having application logic 
          decentralised amongst nodes in a P2P network makes DApps resilient to faults and downtimes. 
          DApps can be connected with various systems to provide traceability, 
          automate business processes and reduce operational costs and overhead in SCM.
